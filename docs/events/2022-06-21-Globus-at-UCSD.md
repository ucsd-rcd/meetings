# Using Globus at UCSD
**June 21, 2022, 2:00 PDT**

Globus is software-as-a-service for research data management and provides high-speed, secure file transfer, and file sharing directly from existing storage systems. Globus is operated by the University of Chicago and uses a freemium model, supported through subscriptions from campuses like UCSD. This gives UCSD researchers access to additional capabalities, including sharing with collaborators and using Globus with protected data.

This meeting will start with a summary review of Globus features targeted at those new to Globus. We will demonstrate how to transfer and share data, and install a Globus Connect Personal endpoint on your laptop. We'll cover some of the UCSD-specific resources available, followed by presentations from two groups that have integrated the Globus services into their web portals.
