# Commercial Cloud Research Activity
**Tuesday, August 9, 2022, 2:00 p.m. PDT**

## Description

Join us for this call wherein attendees will learn 1) how UC San Diego researchers are being supported with cloud computing options through UC agreements with commercial cloud service providers, and 2) researchers will share about their adoption of cloud computing/storage platforms in their workflows.

* We will offer a comparison of the 3 major cloud service provider agreements currently in place with the UC: compare negotiated discounts, egress waivers, IDC waivers, etc.
* Enjoy lightning talks by researchers who have established (or are establishing) workflows using cloud services: why they chose cloud, what they have learned in the process, what types of research activities are well suited.
