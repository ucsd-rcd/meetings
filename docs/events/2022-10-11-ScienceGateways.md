## Description

Science gateways are web platforms that simplify the participation in
science by easing the connection to otherwise difficult to use
resources (like HPC or instruments), sharing data and computational
codes, collaborating, and generating large international audiences for
broader impact. UCSD has been a leader in promoting the use and
creation of science gateways to make resesearch capabilities 
available outside of individual labs or campuses.

This meeting will provide a background on science gateways, including
how to find existing gateway and what tools and platforms are out
there if you want to host a gateway. Contributors to two successful
UCSD science gateways, the [CIPRES
(phylogenetics)](https://www.phylo.org) and the [Qitta
('omics)](https://qiita.ucsd.edu), will describe their portals
and can answer questions about the realities of developing and
operating a gateway.
