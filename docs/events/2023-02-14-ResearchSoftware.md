# Obtaining Research Software and Tools
**February 14, 2023, 2:00 p.m. PST**

## Description

How do you find out if UCSD has an existing software license or
subscription? What about an already negotiated purchasing discount?
And how about the processes to get new applications on managed
devices? This meeting will give you some starting points to handle
these questions.

Software is a fundamental research tool, and many science domains rely
on applications and services requiring a license, subscription, or
other paid usage model. UCSD has several existing resources to help
researchers acquire and use necessary software, including campus
licenses, pre-negotiated discounts, and staff with years of experience
handling software procurement. 

This meeting will be in a panel format, with staff from ITS Software
Licensing Support, UCSD Health's IT Shared Services, the UCSD Library,
and UCSD Research IT. They will be answering questions about:

* how to find existing licenses;
* who to ask for help with software procurement;
* what processes are in place;
* purchasing at different levels (research groups, campus, UC-wide),
* software installation on managed devices;
* how research software is funded;
* and the relation between software and data licensing.

While the focus of this meeting is on paid commercial software, there
is an overlap with open-source applications, especially in the area of
deploying it on managed devices.

We need your input, too! Please join us to talk about software that
could benefit your research and your experience with the procurement
process.
