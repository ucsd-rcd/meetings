How do we address IT needs to ensure our research is successful when
traveling? Especially when the research relies on more than just
packing the right chargers. Research IT can be hard enough, before
working with equipment or data beyond the campus boundary. We'll cover some of the general
recommendations, and share some of the challenges other researchers
have experienced.

We'd love to hear from you about the hurdles you've overcome related
to doing research away from campus!

## Topics

* IT planning for each phase of travel:
  * Before
  * During
  * After
* Foreign vs. domestic travel considerations
* Special cases
  * Export control
  * Field research

### Guidance & Recommendations

UCSD, UCOP, and EDUCAUSE have published general
recommendations about cybersecurity and travel. While these
recommendations are focused on cybersecurity, many of the suggestions
will help protect against accidents or other events.

* UCSD [International Travel Cybersecurity](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/security/user-guides/international-travel.html)
* UCSD Research IT [Best Practices When Traveling](https://research-it.ucsd.edu/otherresources/bp_travel.html)
* UCOP [Traveling with Electronic Devices](https://security.ucop.edu/resources/traveling-with-electronic-devices/) and [IT Guidance](https://security.ucop.edu/resources/traveling-with-electronic-devices/it-guidance.html)
* EDUCAUSE [How to Protect Your Data and Devices While Traveling with Tech](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/9/march-2018-how-to-protect-your-data-and-devices-while-traveling-with-tech)
* EDUCAUSE [Security Tips for Traveling at Home and Abroad](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2016/11/march-2017-security-tips-for-traveling-at-home-and-abroad)

### Export Control

Some devices and data may fall under export control.

* See the export contol FAQ section ["Travel Abroad"](https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/exportcontrol/faq.html)
* PDF: [What you need to know](https://blink.ucsd.edu/_files/sponsor-tab/export/UCSD-intl-travel-awareness.pdf)

### Field Research

Safety plans for field research may require IT considerations, like
having backup communication or network channels.

  Safety](https://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/risk/field-safety-plan.html)
* SIO: [Field Research Safety Planning Requirements](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/portal/safety-scripps/field-research-safety-planning-requirements)
* UCOP: [UC Field Research Safety Manual](https://www.ucop.edu/safety-and-loss-prevention/_files/field-research-safety/uc-field-research-safety-manual.pdf)
