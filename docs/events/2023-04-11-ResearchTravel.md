# IT Needs for Research Travel
**April 11, 2021, 2:00 p.m. PDT**

## Description

How do we address IT needs to ensure our research is successful when
traveling? Especially when the research relies on more than just
packing the right chargers. Research IT can be hard enough, before
working with equipment or data beyond the campus boundary. We'll cover
some general recommendations and share some of the challenges other
researchers have experienced.

### Guidance & Recommendations

UCSD, UCOP, and EDUCAUSE have published general
recommendations about cybersecurity and travel. While these
recommendations focus on cybersecurity, many 
will help protect against accidents or other events.

* UCSD [International Travel Cybersecurity](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/security/user-guides/international-travel.html)
* UCSD Research IT [Best Practices When Traveling](https://research-it.ucsd.edu/otherresources/bp_travel.html)
* UCOP [Traveling with Electronic Devices](https://security.ucop.edu/resources/traveling-with-electronic-devices/) and [IT Guidance](https://security.ucop.edu/resources/traveling-with-electronic-devices/it-guidance.html)
* EDUCAUSE [How to Protect Your Data and Devices While Traveling with Tech](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/9/march-2018-how-to-protect-your-data-and-devices-while-traveling-with-tech)
* EDUCAUSE [Security Tips for Traveling at Home and Abroad](https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2016/11/march-2017-security-tips-for-traveling-at-home-and-abroad)

### Export Control

Some devices and data may fall under export control.

* See the export control FAQ section ["Travel Abroad"](https://blink.ucsd.edu/sponsor/exportcontrol/faq.html)
* PDF: [What you need to know](https://blink.ucsd.edu/_files/sponsor-tab/export/UCSD-intl-travel-awareness.pdf)

### Field Research

Safety plans for field research may require IT considerations, like
having backup communication or network channels.

  Safety](https://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/risk/field-safety-plan.html)
* SIO: [Field Research Safety Planning Requirements](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/portal/safety-scripps/field-research-safety-planning-requirements)
