## Description

Picking a compute resource is more than just a matter of finding
enough cores and memory. During this meeting, we'll discuss some
facets to consider when moving your research computing needs outgrow
your laptop. How productive you'll be on a compute resource can be
impacted by several factors, like the software applications to be run,
the data you're working with, the level and types of support, and
whether the resource is paid vs. "free" (allocated). The presenters
will share recommendations on selecting compute resources, a list of
some campus and national resources, and a few examples from other UCSD
researchers.
