# About the Meetings

The goal of these meetings is to both build the UCSD RCD Community as a self-identifying group, and to provide the Community with resources to succeed.

During the meetings, researchers and RCD professionals can come together to discuss issues important to the UCSD research community, learn about resources, software, tools, and services relevant to our work. Through the meetings, our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsd.edu/g/ucsd-rcd-l), and other modes of communication, the RCD community can share and learn together.

What do you want to talk about and learn more about?

Our meetings are held every other month on the second Tuesday at 2:00
p.m. Upcoming meeting dates:
* August 9, 2022
* October 11, 2022
* December 13, 2022
* February 14, 2023

## Upcoming Meetings

### [Building & Using Science Gateways](./events/2022-10-11-ScienceGateways.html)

Science gateways are web platforms that simplify the participation in
science by easing the connection to otherwise difficult to use
resources (like HPC or instruments), sharing data and computational
codes, collaborating, and generating large international audiences for
broader impact. This meeting will provide a background on science
gateways, including how to find existing gateway and what tools and
platforms are out there if you want to host a gateway. 

Tuesday, October 11, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.
