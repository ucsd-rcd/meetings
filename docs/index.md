# About the Meetings

The goal of these meetings is to both build the UCSD RCD Community as a self-identifying group, and to provide the Community with resources to succeed.

During the meetings, researchers and RCD professionals can come together to discuss issues important to the UCSD research community, learn about resources, software, tools, and services relevant to our work. Through the meetings, our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsd.edu/g/ucsd-rcd-l), and other modes of communication, the RCD community can share and learn together.

What do you want to talk about and learn more about?

Our meetings are held every other month on the second Tuesday at 2:00
p.m. Upcoming meeting dates:
* August 8, 2023
* October 10, 2023
* December 12, 2023

### [Where to Compute? Campus & National Resources](./events/2023-06-13-WhereToCompute.md)

Picking a compute resource is more than just a matter of finding
enough cores and memory. During this meeting, we'll discuss some
facets to consider when your research computing needs outgrow
your laptop. How productive you'll be on a compute resource can be
impacted by several factors, like the software applications to be run,
the data you're working with, the level and types of support, and
whether the resource is paid vs. "free" (allocated). The presenters
will share recommendations on selecting compute resources, a list of
some campus and national resources, and a few examples from other UCSD
researchers.

Tuesday, June 13, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [IT Needs for Research Travel](./events/2023-04-11-ResearchTravel.html)

How do we address IT needs to ensure our research is successful when
traveling? Especially when the research relies on more than just
packing the right chargers. Research IT can be hard enough, before
working with equipment or data beyond the campus boundary. We'll cover some of the general
recommendations, and share some of the challenges other researchers
have experienced.

Tuesday, April 11, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [Obtaining Research Software and Tools](./events/2023-02-14-ResearchSoftware.html)

How do we address IT needs to ensure our research is successful when
traveling? Especially when the research relies on more than just
packing the right chargers. Research IT can be hard enough, before
working with equipment or data beyond the campus boundary. We'll cover
some general recommendations and share some of the challenges other
researchers have experienced.

Tuesday, February 14, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. PST.

### [Building & Using Science Gateways](./events/2022-10-11-ScienceGateways.html)

Science gateways are web platforms that simplify the participation in
science by easing the connection to otherwise difficult to use
resources (like HPC or instruments), sharing data and computational
codes, collaborating, and generating large international audiences for
broader impact. This meeting provided a background on science
gateways, including how to find existing gateways and what tools and
platforms are out there if you want to host a gateway. 

Tuesday, October 11, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [Commercial Cloud Research Activity](./events/2022-08-09-Commercial-Cloud-Research-Activity.html)

A meeting about how UC San Diego researchers are being supported with cloud computing options through UC agreements with commercial cloud service providers and researchers share about their adoption of cloud computing/storage platforms in their workflows.

Tuesday, August 9, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [Using Globus at UCSD](./events/2022-06-21-Globus-at-UCSD.html)

An introduction to the [Globus data management service](https://globus.org/) including campus
resources and presentations by research groups using it.

June 21, 2022, 2:00 p.m. PDT
