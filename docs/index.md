# About the Meetings

The goal of these meetings is to both build the UCSD RCD Community as a self-identifying group, and to provide the Community with resources to succeed.

During the meetings, researchers and RCD professionals can come together to discuss issues important to the UCSD research community, learn about resources, software, tools, and services relevant to our work. Through the meetings, our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/ucsd.edu/g/ucsd-rcd-l), and other modes of communication, the RCD community can share and learn together.

What do you want to talk about and learn more about?

Our meetings are held every other month on the second Tuesday at 2:00
p.m. Upcoming meeting dates:
* April 11, 2023
* June 13, 2023
* August 8, 2023

## Past Meetings

Recording, slides, and notes are available on the pages for past meetings.

### [IT Needs for Research Travel](./events/2023-04-11-ResearchTravel.html)

How do we address IT needs to ensure our research is successful when
traveling? Especially when the research relies on more than just
packing the right chargers. Research IT can be hard enough, before
working with equipment or data beyond the campus boundary. We'll cover some of the general
recommendations, and share some of the challenges other researchers
have experienced.

Tuesday, April 11, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [Obtaining Research Software and Tools](./events/2023-02-14-ResearchSoftware.html)

How do we address IT needs to ensure our research is successful when
traveling? Especially when the research relies on more than just
packing the right chargers. Research IT can be hard enough, before

### [Building & Using Science Gateways](./events/2022-10-11-ScienceGateways.html)

Science gateways are web platforms that simplify the participation in
science by easing the connection to otherwise difficult to use
resources (like HPC or instruments), sharing data and computational
codes, collaborating, and generating large international audiences for
broader impact. This meeting provided a background on science
gateways, including how to find existing gateways and what tools and
platforms are out there if you want to host a gateway. 

Tuesday, October 11, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [Commercial Cloud Research Activity](./events/2022-08-09-Commercial-Cloud-Research-Activity.html)

A meeting about how UC San Diego researchers are being supported with cloud computing options through UC agreements with commercial cloud service providers and researchers share about their adoption of cloud computing/storage platforms in their workflows.

Tuesday, August 9, 2022, at 2:00 p.m. PDT.

### [Using Globus at UCSD](./events/2022-06-21-Globus-at-UCSD.html)

An introduction to the [Globus data management service](https://globus.org/) including campus
resources and presentations by research groups using it.

June 21, 2022, 2:00 p.m. PDT
