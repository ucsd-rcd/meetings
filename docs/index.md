# UC San Diego Research Computing & Data (RCD) Community

Researchers and RCD professionals can come together to discuss issues important to the UCSD research community, learn about resources, software, tools, and services relevant to our work. Through regular meetings, a mailing list, and other modes of communication, the RCD community can share and learn together. What do you want to talk about and learn more about?
